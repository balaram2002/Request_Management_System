# 📌 Request Management System

During my internship, I developed the **Request Management System**, an application crafted to streamline and manage organizational requests. The goal was to create a centralized platform that enhances workflow and improves communication across departments.

The system begins with a **secure login screen**, ensuring only authorized users can access the dashboard. Once logged in, users can:
- ✍️ Create new requests
- 📊 Track request status
- 🗂 Manage previous submissions

This platform greatly enhances operational efficiency by allowing transparent and structured handling of employee or departmental requests.

✅ It is **fully functional** and production-ready, capable of boosting organizational productivity.  
🔥 Built with real-time feedback, security, and user experience in mind.
